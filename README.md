## About

This repository contains the source code for a fullstack web development course which is based on University of Helsinki's [Fullstack Open Curriculum](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) teaching React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript among others. The source code for the original course can be found [here](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/fullstack-hy2020.github.io).

For this version of the course mostly the frontend parts were rewritten to show the same frontend concepts/equivalents using Vue.js.

## Website

The content of the website is generated from markdown documents using [VuePress v2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) for static site generation. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used as a bundler during development.
The website also contains a searchbar, a darkmode and a "go to top"-button.
